      <p class="intro my_item left">Hello everyone! My name is Aaliyah Edwards and I'm pleased to welcome you to my personal About Me page where I professional information and personal information about my life.
        This page is also part of my learning journey in the world of Web Development, to showcase my skillset.
        As I continue to hone my development skills, I will update this page to reflect that. Thank you

    <h2>Personal life</h2>
        <p class="my_item right">I am 29 years old and currently live in Tulsa, OK. I am a software development student with Correlation One, an educational organization partnered with Amazon. 
          I am also currently employed at Amazon as a Fullfilment Center Associate and at Hillcrest Medical Center as a PBX Operator. 
          I have been employed with Amazon for about 2 years and at Hillcrest for over 3 and a half years. I am hoping to shift into the field of software and web development, 
          as I've always had an interest in computers and technology. When I'm not working or studying, I like to play games, read, watch anime, shop, spend time with family and friends, watch ASMR and more! 
          I have 1 younger brother and through him, I have 4 beautiful nieces who are my pride and joy. They are the closest thing to children that I have, as I don’t have any of my own. I have included a picture of each below, aren’t they adorable?!<br></p>
        <p class="my_item left">My name is Aaliyah and I'm currently 28 years old and live in Tulsa, OK. I work part-time at the DOK2 Amazon site in Tulsa as a Sortation Associate for the Prime For Same Day Team and have been on this team for almost two years (August 20th). 
          I also work for Hillcrest Medical Center in Tulsa and have been there for over 3 and a half years! Some of my favorite hobbies include gaming, reading books, anime, spending time with family, and shopping. 
          I am currently a student of a Software/Web Development course through an organization called Correlation One. This site is the start of my work that I will be displaying as part of my learning journey in web development. 
          I have a bit of a background in Computer Science and I'd like to briefly talk about it. I was previously studying at Tulsa Community College and Oklahoma State University (Go Pokes). 
          I graduated from TCC with an AS in Mathematics in 2015 and an AS in Computer Information Systems after I changed my major and started my journey again in 2019. I attended OSU-Tulsa starting in 2019 as well and was majoring in Computer Science. 
          I'm actually close to graduating, but I had stopped attending in 2022 after going through some personal things in life. I plan to go back and finish getting my Bachelor's to add to my credentials. 
          I have added my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaliyah-edwards-4364977b/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> here, and at the bottom of the page, if you'd like to view more information regarding my professional upcoming. 
          If you'd like a glimpse of my personal life, I'm mainly on Facebook and Twitter, which I've plugged the links for at the bottom of the page.</p>

        <h2>Work Experience/Goals</h2>
        <p class="my_item right"><b>As of right now, I currently work two jobs. I have been working part-time at Amazon since August 2021. 
          I work for the PFSD (Prime for Same Day) team at DOK2 Tulsa. Our team is super amazing and currently holds the
          record for most days with On Time Dispatch for our region (17 days), which consists of Colorado/Texas/Oklahoma. 
          I work overnight, full-time at Hillcrest Medical Center as a PBX Operator. With that, I answer calls from outside and within the hospital, 
          I run emergency codes and do some general computer/office work as well. I have been here since December 2019.
          One of my main goals for right now, is to go from having two jobs to one job in my field of interest. 
          I hope that this course, and potentially finishing my degree in CS, will elevate that pursuit as well. 
          While Software Development is the major pursuit career wise, I have also considered such fields as Cybersecurity and Video Game Development as well. 
          Whatever path that I take, I hope that it's one that I will enjoy and experience longevity and endless learning. 
          It would be unhonest of me to not mention my hopes of a career that will pay off financially. 
          Such things as how tough things are today and my background/upbringing fuel this hope. </b></p>
      
        <h2>Education/Achievements</h2>
        <p class="my_item left"> I graduated from a little charter school named Dove Science Academy in 2012. After I graduated from high school,
         I went on to attend Tulsa Community College, where I graduated with an A.S. in Mathematics in 2015.  
         After that, I transferred to Northeastern State University from 2015-2016, but stopped attending after Spring 2016. 
         I took a hiatus for a couple of years, where I mainly worked full-time and took care of my parents and brother. 
         I decided to go back to school in 2018 and applied to Oklahoma State University for the Spring 2019 semester.  
         This is where I decided to change my major to Computer Science. I changed my major because I was so interested in working with computers and technology and wanted to go into a field that would ensure that. 
         I currently have a couple of courses left before I graduate with my Bachelor's and I plan to finish in the Spring.
         Another thing that I consider an achievement was discovering and applying for this program. I know that it's just
         the second week, but I'm enjoying the experience and everything that we've learned so far.</p>
