    <h2>Mini Blog</h2>
    <div class="my_item right p_content">
    <p>My journey to becoming a web developer has been quite a ride. I feel that I should start at the point when my interest of computers peaked. 
      I had always been interested in computers since I was very young. I considered majoring in something related to computers after graduating high school, but chose to major in Mathematics, which is my favorite subject. 
      I changed my major years later to Computer Science because I wanted to learn coding and pursue a career in this field. <br> I am currently in a Software/Web Development course through Correlation One, sponsored by Amazon. 
      I joined this course due to my interest in Computer Science. Software Development is the main field that I'm interested in, so after looking through our company's Career Choice site, that offers PLENTY of opportunities for further education of many fields, I found this program and felt that I would be a great fit due to my background. 
      Also, with everything that the program offers outside of the curriculum such as professional development resources, assistance with job placement, and more, I knew that this opportunity would help propel me further. <br> 
      We started out with learning HTML, which was fun. We have just finished learned about CSS, which was exciting as it makes styling our pages SO MUCH better and easier! I can't wait to create more expansive works as I hone my skills to show all of you! Thank you as well for visiting my site.

      <h2>Personal Blog -- let's talk!</h2>
      <div class="my_item left p_content">
      <p>In my About Me page, I talked a bit about myself on a professional level.
        Now, let's talk on a personal level. I would like to start with my hobbies.
        Some of my hobbies include gaming, browsing social media, spending time with family and friends, shopping online and more!

        <li>Gaming!!!
            <p>I have loved and been playing video games since I was 4 years old. This came from watching my
                dad play video games. When he wasn't taking care of me or working, he was gaming it up.
                The first video game that I ever played was a demo for Tomb Raider 2. I loved that little
                demo so much and is how I came to love the series' main protagonist, Lara Croft. I loved
                playing the TR installments, along with Mario games, style games, Sims game and more as a 
                child. My gaming taste has expanded over the years as I've gotten older.
                For example, I would watch my mom and dad play Resident Evil anytime, but I'd never play it myself.
                This changed when I decided to play through Resident Evil 4 because there were certain parts of
                the game that I hadn't seen and I wanted to see it myself.

        <li>Social Media - Uh Oh!
            <p>I use majority of the main forms of social media today, such as Facebook, X (It will always be Twitter),
                Instagram and Snapchat(I don't use them as much), and TikTok. I also use YouTube pretty frequently as well.
